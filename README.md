# MegaRepo

## Computer Science or IT is a very broad field.

There is just so much to learn- just the sheer amount of choices paralyze us- learn this or that.
I have spent countless hours hopping back and forth among so many fields trying a bit and testing it out. Before getting into too much depth, I tend to quit learning it and hop onto another trending topic and start learning about that.
Thus the inception of this project.

I aim to make this a megarepo for all the CS fields so that it becomes a resource for all CS students and help them finding a field to concentrate and focus toward before moving to the next buzzword we hear.

This is by no means complete or exhaustive. One person cannot know it all and there is so much to learn.
If you are an expert of a domain- do make a pull request - al you need to do it to modify megarepo.JSON file.
Or send me details of what to include on aansari108d@gmail.com

# Happy learning!!
